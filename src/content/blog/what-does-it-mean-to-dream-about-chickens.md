In psychoanalysis, dreams are a window into the subconscious, revealing memories, feelings, and emotions that are not always visible in daily life. Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung, two of the great experts in this field, claimed that dreams reflect hidden aspects of our mind without judgment or interference.

Dreaming about chickens, a common animal in many dreams, can be related to themes such as fear, indecision, or the desire for freedom. If you have dreamed about chickens, here is a guide to what each type of dream can mean, including dead, black, white, or brown chickens.
