Dreams often feature the person who holds a special place in our hearts, evoking intense emotions like butterflies in our stomachs. When we are deeply attracted to someone, our dreams frequently reflect our thoughts and feelings about them. In this article from AnalyzeMyDream, we delve into what it means to dream about the person you like, whether the dream involves kissing, being with someone else, not speaking to you, or making love.

### What Does It Mean to Dream About Kissing the Person You Like?

A dream where you kiss the person you like does not necessarily predict that this kiss will occur in real life. Instead, it indicates a strong desire to connect more deeply with that person. This dream may reflect your wish to get closer, engage in meaningful conversations, or perform small acts that might lead to a deeper connection.

### What Does It Mean to Dream About the Person You Like Not Speaking to You?

When you dream that the person you like is not talking to you, it may reveal your anxieties about whether your feelings are being reciprocated. You might feel that despite your efforts to capture their attention, your actions seem futile. This dream could be a signal to reevaluate the situation and consider moving on, as this person may not share your feelings. Remember, there are numerous opportunities out there.

### What Does It Mean to Dream About Making Love with the Person You Like?

Dreams about making love with the person you are attracted to usually reflect your deep desire for a closer relationship. Such dreams often express a wish to advance in the relationship but can also indicate an obsession. It’s important to reflect on whether these dreams are a manifestation of genuine feelings or an overwhelming preoccupation.
