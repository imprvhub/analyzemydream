One of the most common dreams is the one in which that special person appears and makes us feel butterflies in our stomach. When we are in love or attracted to someone, our thoughts often revolve around that person. His beauty, his way of being or the way he treats us can influence our dreams, since they reflect our deepest thoughts and feelings.

Dreaming about your platonic love is usually positive and often reflects your desires for that person. In this AnalyzeMyDream article, we explain what it means to dream about the person you like, considering if they kiss you, they don't talk to you, they are with someone else, or you are making love.

### What does it mean to dream about the person you like and kisses you?

Dreaming that you kiss the person you like does not guarantee that such a kiss will materialize in reality. This dream rather suggests that your inner self longs to get closer to that person and create complicity with them. It may be a reflection of your desire to get closer, talk to him or make small gestures that could eventually lead to that long-awaited kiss.


### What does it mean to dream about the person you like and they are with someone else?

If you dream of the person you like accompanied by another person, your subconscious could be telling you that it is time to leave that unrequited love behind and seek new horizons. Alternatively, if your crush seems sad around her date, she may be signaling to you that you could be the one to help her through a difficult or overwhelming situation.


### What does it mean to dream about the person you like who doesn't talk to you?

Dreaming about the person you like not speaking to you may reflect your insecurity about whether you are being reciprocated. You may feel like you've done everything you can to get her attention and that every effort seems in vain. This dream may be a sign for you to consider moving on, as that person may not share your same feelings. Remember that there are many more opportunities in the world. 

### What does it mean to dream about the person you like making love

Dreaming about the person you like making love to you is usually a reflection of your deep desires to become more intimate with them. This dream can express your desire to move forward in the relationship, although it can also reflect an obsession with that person.

### Other meanings of dreaming about the person you like

- **Dreaming that you dance with the person you like**: Reflects your desire to have a full and happy relationship with that person.
- **Dreaming that the person you like has an accident**: It may indicate that you are worrying too much about that person's problems.
- **Dreaming that the person you like proposes to you**: Although this dream is not premonitory, it can express your desire to find happiness in love with someone special.
- **Dreaming that the person you like rejects you**: This dream may be related to a lack of self-esteem and self-confidence. Remember that you deserve love and that you have a lot of value.
