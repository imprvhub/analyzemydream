Dreaming about a fight can have different interpretations, such as internal conflicts, the need to solve problems, control your emotions and fears, or the possibility of something unexpected happening. The dream world is full of mysteries that we often do not know how to interpret, and it is common to encounter situations in dreams that have no direct relationship with daily life, which can be disconcerting.

One of those dreams is dreaming about a fight without having been involved in one. This does not always mean something negative, since the interpretation will depend on whether you are participating in the altercation or if you are simply an observer. In this AnalyzeMyDream article, we will tell you what it means to dream about fights and we will give you keys to find the meaning of this type of dreams.
