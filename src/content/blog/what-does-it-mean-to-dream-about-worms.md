### Meaning of dreams according to Sigmund Freud

According to Sigmund Freud, dreams can reveal contents of our unconscious, such as memories, desires or repressed needs. Knowing the meaning of dreams and analyzing what we dream can offer you a clearer vision of yourself and your current emotions.

Freud suggests that to interpret a dream, you should consider the following questions:
- Who appears in the dream?
- What is the problem that is presented?
- How is the problem solved?
- What feelings and sensations do you experience?

In addition to these questions, it is important to understand what the object in the dream represents. In this case, worms.
