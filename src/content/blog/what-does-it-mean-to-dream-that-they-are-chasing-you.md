#### What does it mean to dream that you are being chased and you cannot run

In order to know what the meaning of dreaming that you are being chased is, we have to keep in mind that it can be a very subjective and personal interpretation. However, in general terms, we can group this dream into 5 major interpretations, which are the following:

1. **Being worried about something** 
Dreaming that you are being chased can be a symbol in itself of something that is really affecting you currently in your life. For example, a situation pending resolution. A fact that follows you wherever you go no matter how much you ignore it or try to postpone it. In that case, this type of dream is usually associated with the experience of some concern that produces uncertainty for some reason.

2. **Situation of personal change** 
When you experience a chase during a dream, there is a reality that is left behind and a new scenario of arrival. In that case, observing this dream as a metaphor for life itself, this information can also refer to the need for a change in some aspect of your present. A necessary change that brings with it a new air of freedom by helping you connect with a new living space.

3. **State of stress** 
Stress affects our well-being so directly that it not only influences our daily lifestyle, but also our own rest. Stress affects the quality of sleep and also causes nightmares that are the result of a mood. When you are stressed, you suffer more daily tensions, you focus more on negative aspects, you are more vulnerable to the effects of worries, you feel fear... All of this, therefore, also influences your own rest. In this other article we offer you four exercises to channel stress.
