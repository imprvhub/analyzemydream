### Meaning of dreaming about the end of the world with water

Dreaming about the end of the world with Water has one of the most positive meanings. This dream suggests that you are on the right path to resolve conflicts that concern you. Water in dreams symbolizes purification, and if the world is destroyed with water, it indicates that your energies are at their maximum and that you are ready to make your plans come true. In addition, this dream may reflect that your conscience is at peace and that you have pure thoughts. It is common among teenagers who go through significant changes. If this is your case, be patient with yourself.

Dreaming about the end of the world with fire reflects the end of a stage in your life, whether in love, work or personal life. If the fire consumes petrified figures in the dream, it is a sign that this change is inevitable. If the fire consumes you, it could symbolize fear and the need to allow yourself new experiences. Analyze if there is any repressed desire, such as an unexpected trip or a love relationship that you do not dare to start. Fire may be suggesting that you face your fears without letting fear paralyze you.
