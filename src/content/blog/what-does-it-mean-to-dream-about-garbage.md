### Meaning of dreaming about garbage in bags

Dreaming about **garbage in bags** is a sign that there are **things in your life that are not letting you move forward**. This may include negative feelings, hidden emotions, guilt, or regrets from the past that you have not been able to heal. 

It is a call to make significant changes in your life. Release those burdens and purify your interior. Talk to someone you trust or consider walking away from a **toxic relationship**. Easing your spirit will help you see things more clearly and allow you to be happy.

### Meaning of dreaming about garbage on the street

Dreaming about **garbage on the street** has a positive meaning. This dream indicates that **you know well what you want and you have the tools to achieve it**. However, there are additional nuances:

- **You are throwing garbage on the street**: You need to free your mind from annoying memories and thoughts. Let go of what makes you uncomfortable, since carrying harmful emotions does not benefit you.

- **You see a mountain of garbage on the street**: This suggests an accumulation of unresolved problems. Analyze each problem and solve it one by one to find emotional balance.

### Meaning of dreaming about garbage in someone else's house

If in your dream you see someone else's house full of garbage, this may indicate that **someone close to you is making bad decisions**. You may feel worried about that person and want to help them avoid problems. Remember that you can help to a certain extent; Your support is valuable, but know your limits.

This dream can also reflect **unsatisfied desires, lies or deceptions** that someone has caused you. Don't let these emotions make you bitter.

- **Dissatisfaction**: It can represent dissatisfaction with what you have. Evaluate if you are being greedy or if you truly believe that you can improve your assets with effort and dedication. Avoid bad investments out of ambition so as not to lose money.

- **Emotional maturity**: Alternatively, this dream may indicate that you are making **correct decisions** without getting carried away by your feelings, showing your evolution and overcoming bad energies. !! Congratulations!!
