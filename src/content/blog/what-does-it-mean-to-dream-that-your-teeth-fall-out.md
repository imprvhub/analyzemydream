Dreaming that your teeth fall out has many variants, such as, for example, dreaming that a tooth falls out from the top. According to the interpretation of dreams, dreaming that your upper teeth fall out can represent that you have suffered the loss of an important person for you.

Likewise, dreaming that your upper teeth fall out is almost always related to insecurity. In this sense, it is important to keep in mind that teeth are one of the hardest and most stable parts of the human body.

In a metaphorical sense, what we can interpret is that we feel fragile or insecure. This can indicate that there is something in our life that worries us or that we do not feel as strong as usual and, therefore, in the dream world of dreams our teeth fall out.
