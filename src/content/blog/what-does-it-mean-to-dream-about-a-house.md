Dreaming about a house generally represents one's self and different aspects of one's personality. Each room can symbolize emotions, memories, or specific areas of one's life. There are dreams that are considered very strange, the product of a mixture of feelings and thoughts of the person. However, there is a long list of dreams that people often have, and you have probably already had one of them, possibly even several times. For example, dreaming about a house is one of the most common dreams. 
Dreams are more important than we give them, because dreaming is interpreting the reality we live every day and our most frequent feelings, emotions and thoughts. In this article from AnalyzeMyDream, we explain the 
meaning of dreaming about a house, focusing on the meaning of dreaming about a new house, a big one, an old one and one with many rooms.

#### What does it mean to dream of a big house

The meaning of dreaming of a house can vary depending on the house itself, but also depending on the actions or intentions of the dream: it is not the same to dream of visiting a house, than to dream of buying a house or Dreaming of a house under construction. 
Specifically, what does it mean to dream of a big, beautiful house? Dreaming of a house can have different meanings, depending on how the house is shown in our subconscious. First of all, it is important to know that the concept of a house in dreams is usually 
the representation of ourselves, a reflection of what we are, what we want to have and our fears. In addition, each room that makes up the house is a reference to a personal aspect that characterizes us. 
In this sense, if you dream of a big house it means that you are having a life full of professional
successes, and on an economic and family level the atmosphere is pleasant and problem-free. 

#### Meaning of dreaming of an old house

This same meaning is also attributed to dreaming about a dirty, abandoned or ugly house.

#### What does it mean to dream about a new house

As with the dream of having a big house, if the house is also new, it is possible that you know or have the feeling that very soon your life will undergo a positive and successful change.
