For psychoanalysis, dreams have to do directly with the emotions, thoughts and sensations that you have when you are conscious, but that you find difficult to express. Therefore, it is common to dream about things that you are always in contact with, and even those that you do not usually see, such as bulls. Dreaming about bulls is usually very positive, because they are territorial, strong, persistent and very poised animals, so it speaks of your tenacity and integrity to face adversity, although it can also be associated with threats and insecurities. Dreaming about wild, loose, brown or white bulls is not the same. Everything will depend on the context of the dream. In this AnalyzeMyDream article, we will talk about what it means to dream about bulls, specifically, about black, loose, wild bulls that chase you or attack you. Here you will have all the keys to find the meaning of your dream.

#### What does it mean to dream of black bulls

Dreaming of black bulls has several meanings that depend on how you felt in the episode. For example, if you were afraid, it is because you are going through a stage of vulnerability, and you sense that something or someone can hurt you. Remember that the color black in psychology evokes mystery and distrust of the unknown, so it is likely that you feel some fear at the moment. Do not let fear paralyze you, rather try to identify what you fear, and face it with determination.

Likewise, if in your dream you were excited to see an elegant and imposing black bull, then it means that you are ready for a profound transformation. A time has come in your life when you are not afraid to take new risks, and that fills you with satisfaction. You feel that you are on the right path to achieving your goals, thanks to the courage and strength that you have put into that project. In any case, dreaming about still black bulls is not the same as dreaming about brave black bulls chasing you.
