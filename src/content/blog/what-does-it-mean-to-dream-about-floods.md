### What does it mean to dream of a flood in the street

Dreaming of a flood in the street can reflect negative emotions such as anger and resentment towards someone. Identifying the details of the dream, such as the state of the water and the cause of the flood, can help you interpret the message:

- **The street was flooded with crystal-clear water**: It indicates that you feel comfortable with the people around you in your family and work life. Crystal clear water symbolizes transparency and sincere affection.
- **The street was flooded with murky water**: It can indicate conflicts at hand or getting involved in questionable actions that could result in problems. It is advisable to stay away from toxic people and avoid misunderstandings.
- **The street was flooded with sea water**: If the dream shows a tsunami, it reflects anxiety and stress. Analyzing your fears and seeking inner peace is the most appropriate. 

- **You were drowning in the flood**: This distressing dream can indicate the presence of treacherous people or untreated health problems. Consider a medical check-up and pay attention to the people in your environment.
