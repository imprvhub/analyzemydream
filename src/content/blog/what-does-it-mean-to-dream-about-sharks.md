Dreams, according to different psychoanalysts such as Sigmund Freud, are the reflection of emotions and feelings repressed during waking hours, which tend to emerge when the brain is at rest. Therefore, it is important that you decipher what your subconscious wants to tell you. In them, it is common for different animals that we encounter daily to appear, such as dogs, cats, and birds, but when we dream of ferocious species such as sharks, this tends to confuse.

Dreaming about sharks is associated with anxiety, anguish, and worries, although also, depending on the context in which the animal appeared, it is related to strength and motivation to move forward. Remember that each dream is unique and its meaning can vary from person to person. If you had this kind of dream and you don't know how to interpret it, in this Dream Insights article, we will tell you what it means to dream about sharks, specifically about sharks in the sea, in a pool, large sharks, white sharks, and even what it means when this shark attacks you in your dream episode.

#### Meaning of dreaming about sharks in the sea

If you dreamed of sharks in the sea, it is a clear sign that you feel overwhelmed by a series of problems and you find it difficult to concentrate. In addition, the dream tells you that there are people around you trying to attack you, so it is not a good time to trust everyone.

If the sharks were swimming in the open sea, this speaks of confusion, fears and insecurities that prevent you from moving towards a higher level of emotional balance. Most likely, you will have to make decisions that will cost you at first, but in the long run will be the best for your well-being. 

#### Meaning of dreaming about sharks in a pool

Pools represent a connection with the deepest emotions stored inside you. If you dreamed of a shark in a pool, it symbolizes that you have repressed sexual desires or a need for greater attention in love. You may have met someone who attracts you sexually and you want to establish a more intimate relationship with that person. In this dream, the shark represents the ferocity and willingness you have to live an adventure intensely.

#### Meaning of dreaming about white sharks

In the interpretation of dreams, dreaming about white sharks indicates that something is bothering you and you cannot figure out what it is. The good thing about this dream episode is that it is a warning for you to use your cunning and intelligence and manage to identify your discomforts.

The white color of the shark represents the courage and tenacity that you have, but that you find difficult to bring to the surface, because for psychoanalysis, white speaks of renewal and profound changes. Consequently, your dream tells you that despite there being obstacles in the way, you will know how to successfully emerge from any situation, as long as you believe in your own abilities.

#### What does it mean to dream about big sharks

Dreaming about big sharks means that not everyone who claims to be your friend actually is. There may be fake people around you who are trying to confuse you into trusting them and then betray you. It is good that you act with caution and prudence.

In addition, there are other contexts that can explain dreaming about big sharks:

- **You see a big dead shark:** in this case your dream tells you that there is a person near you watching your steps to help you. It could be a friend from work or a family member who is willing to lend a hand when you need it.
- **You are swimming with big sharks:** symbolizes that you are about to experience many problems, especially at work. You are having a hard time achieving a goal that you set for yourself and you feel that you have little support. Rather, you notice that others want to take credit for your merits.

#### What does it mean to dream aboutSmall sharks

For dream interpretation, dreaming about small sharks is an indication that there are minor concerns lurking in your head, but if you do not start to solve them immediately, they can become a major inconvenience. On the other hand, if you see many small sharks in your dreams, it may be a metaphor that you long to take care of a family, or perhaps have a child in the near future.

#### What does it mean to dream about sharks that do not attack

Docile sharks cause curiosity and are surprising. Therefore, dreaming about sharks that do not attack speaks of the mental strength that you are able to bring to the surface when necessary. When you feel threatened, you tend to analyze the entire context to act intelligently and do not get carried away by emotions. If you dreamed of swimming among sharks that do not attack, it is a good omen and a symbolization of your ability to reflect in the face of adversity. 

On the other hand, dreaming about sharks that don't attack also represents the presence of someone lurking and waiting for you to be careless in order to play a dirty trick on you. As we already mentioned, stay alert so that you can detect that malicious person and get them out of your life in time.

#### What does it mean to dream about sharks that attack

Did you dream about a shark that attacks and you don't know what it means? If in your dream you were attacked by a shark, it is natural that you felt anguish and despair. This dream episode represents an emotional burden that you are carrying. It is advisable that you release the negative feelings that you have repressed, since they can do you a lot of harm if you do not resolve them in time. Pay close attention to your self-esteem and handle with caution any insecurities that you may have.

If in the dream you were the one who defeated the shark, it symbolizes the power of will that exists within you and the desire to overcome whatever comes your way, since you are demanding with yourself and you do not lose control despite adversity.
