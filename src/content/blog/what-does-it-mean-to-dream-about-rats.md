### Meaning of dreaming about big rats

If you often dream about big rats, it's normal for you to wonder what that means. The meaning of dreaming about rats can vary, just like all dreams, depending on different variables such as size. The psychological and social meaning of rats is often associated with fear, rejection and dislike.

According to Carl Gustav Jung's theory of the collective unconscious, many of our dreams are influenced by the social impact that some symbols have on our society, so dreaming about live rats can be closely related to unresolved problems, fears and nervousness.

According to Sigmund Freud's theory of dream interpretation, dreams can reveal details of the unconscious. However, in order to correctly interpret a dream, we must pay attention to all the details.

Ultimately, if you are wondering what it means to dream about a rat, you should know that it is related to changes. A change may be approaching in any area of ​​your life. You can find out what that change might be like by analyzing other characteristics of the dream such as the color of the rat or your feelings during the dream.

### What does it mean to dream of white rats

According to some experts in dream interpretation, the color of the rats we dream about is also important, since it can show some aspects of our subconscious that we have not yet analyzed. Next, we will analyze the different meanings of dreaming of white, black and gray rats:

- **Dreaming of white rats**: if you wonder what the meaning of dreaming of white rats is, you should know that according to theories about symbology, white rats represent the day, a positive attitude and optimism. Thus, dreaming of white rats can mean that, despite having problems that you must face, you have an optimistic view of life and you see yourself capable of overcoming any obstacle.

- **Dreaming of black rats**: on the other hand, dreaming of black rats represents the night, fear and a pessimistic attitude. If in your dream the rats were black, there may be a more pessimistic and negative view of the conflict that you must address. Likewise, some experts claim that it is a harbinger of betrayal and falsehood.

- **Dreaming of gray rats**: the gray color represents neutrality, which is the position we adopt when faced with a problem according to the interpretation of dreams. Dreaming of gray rats indicates a possible hidden tendency in our unconscious to not express feelings, so we do not face the problem, in this case, symbolized by a rat.

### What does it mean to dream of dead rats

### Dreaming about rats biting you

Finally, it is important to analyze other characteristics of the rat you dream about. The meaning of dreaming about big rats that bite us can be closely related to the feeling that we get from just thinking about it. Dreaming about a big, fat rat presents us with a problem that we perceive as impossible to solve.

Also, if the rat bites us in the dream it means that we are afraid that this problem could put our mental health at risk. Remember that rats are associated with illness and a rat bite in dreams is a powerful symbol that quite clearly reflects the fear that something negative will happen to us.
