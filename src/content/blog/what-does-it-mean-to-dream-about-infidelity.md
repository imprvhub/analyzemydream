#### What does it mean to dream of your own infidelity

In this first section We will explain what it means to dream that you are cheating on your partner. Although many people associate this dream directly with desires for betrayal, it actually involves different meanings. One of them is that the couple may be going through a time where there is no good communication. This causes projects not to flow as they should, because each one has a different opinion. If this is your case, both must work to come to an agreement. Only then will they be able to move forward.

Another meaning of dreaming about your own infidelity is that you are not happy with what you are currently experiencing. In some areas of your life you are not calm. It may be on a personal, work, love or even financial level. Therefore, the dream is a sign that you want to get out of that situation and give another direction to your existence.

On the other hand, dreaming that you are cheating on your partner has to do with sexual distancing with your partner. You want to resume passion, which causes this type of dream to arise.

You are not used to treating people badly or hurting them. You may have recently had some problem with someone close to you and this does not make you feel very good.

Also, dreaming about being cheating and regretting it reflects that, despite the circumstances you may experience, you will always be **present and willing to solve the problems** you have in your life as a couple.

#### What does it mean to dream about being cheating and being discovered

Dreaming that you cheat on your partner and they discover you basically means a **strong sign of personal insecurity**. You fear that they will know what you are really like because of the **fear of being judged**. You should know that your fears will diminish as you are able to face them. Even so, to achieve this you should not hide them or put them aside, on the contrary, it is time for you to take a firm stance, look ahead and start believing in your own **capabilities**.

- **You dreamed that your partner is cheating with a family member in front of you**: you possibly feel that your partner has better communication with that family member, which makes you jealous. Remember that if you speak honestly, misunderstandings can be resolved.
- **You dreamed that your partner is cheating with a friend in front of you**: this indicates a certain level of distrust that you feel towards that friend. It is good that you listen to your subconscious, since perhaps that person wants to hurt you and you have not noticed it.
